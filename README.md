# Learning_Repository 
A learning object can be described as ”an entity that can be both numeric and non-numeric, can
be used for education or training, and can be reused or referenced in a technology-enabled learning
environment.” So any learning object can be considered as a module with four basic features -
• The learning object should be reusable.
• The learning object should be flexible.
• The learning object should be accessible.
• The learning object should be interoperable.
